We set the position to fixed, the top and left properties to 0 to make the navbar stick to the top-left corner of the screen.\nWe set the background-color to #f0f0f0 to give the navbar a light gray color.\nInside the navbar div, we create an unordered list (ul) to contain the navbar items.\nWe set the list-style-type to none, and remove any margins and padding to remove any default styling from the list.\nWe set the padding of the list items (li) to 10px to give them some space.\nWe create links (a) inside each list item to create the actual navbar items.
